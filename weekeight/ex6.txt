TASK:
machine has 16-bit virtual addresses. Pages are 8 KB. How many entries are needed for a single-level linear page table? Explain your computations.

SOLUTION:
* S-L LP (single level linear paging)
* one entry in single page table/virtual page
* 2 byte virtual addr, 2^3*1024 bytes for all pages
* 2^16 addr bytes
* -------------- (division)
* 2^13 bytes/page
* =============== (equal)
* 2^3 entries

ANSWER: 2^3
