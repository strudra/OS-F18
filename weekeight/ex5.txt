TASK: difference between a physical and a virtual address

FACTS USED: 
* RAM visualised as sequence of bytes
* each byte has physical address
* CPU uses this physical address when reading/writing to RAM

SOME KEY DIFFERENCES:
* virtual memory is frequently used to allow each process to run in its own virtual address space (VAS)
* processes can benefit greatly from VAS:
	* gives the programmer an illusion of having 'infinite' memory
	* isolation of processes
* virtual memory is a mapping to the actual physical address
* virtual memory larger than physical
* virtual memory stored in HD, while physical memory is RAM
